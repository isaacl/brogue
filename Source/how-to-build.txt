COMPILING BROGUE
----------------

You need libtcod-1.5.1b2 to compile Brogue yourself.

Find the appropriate version at:
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

Or download directly:
 * for mingw: http://doryen.eptalys.net/?file_id=27
 * for Visual Studio: http://doryen.eptalys.net/?file_id=29



USING THE PROJECT FILE (brogue.cbp)
-----------------------------------

Get the mingw version of libtcod-1.5.1b2.

If you do not have Code::Blocks, go to
 * http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows
and get the version that includes mingw.

You must unzip and put libtcod-1.5.1 in "Brogue Source" (alongside
"BrogueCode" and "PlatformCode") for the project to work unchanged.

Happy hacking.
