./brogue is a shell script that will detect terminal and invoke bin/brogue
with the appropriate switches and in the correct working folder.  It therefore
serves as an acceptable target for a desktop shortcut (see 
make-link-for-desktop.sh for an easy way to make one.)  It will pass command
line arguments along to bin/brogue.  The following are accepted:

-t	force terminal mode
-s	force libtcod mode with an SDL renderer
-gl	force libtcod mode with an OpenGL renderer (default)

The switch that you pass to ./brogue will override the -t it appends in
terminal mode, so ./brogue -gl will start brogue in the traditional libtcod
window.

Regrettably, SDL is initialized automatically at present no matter what switch
you supply, unless bin/brogue has been built without libtcod support.


The Makefile accepts these targets:
	make tcod
	make curses
	make both

If you build for curses only, libtcod is not required and SDL will not be linked
or initialized at runtime.  If you build for tcod only, you do not need ncurses-dev.
If you make either 'tcod' or 'both', the Makefile will automatically download the
32-bit version of libtcod for you and untar it in the right place (in src).

To produce a distributable tar file, make tar.  To clean (as you must after changing
headers or before switching targets -- sorry about that), make clean.

make both is the default.
