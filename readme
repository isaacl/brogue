Be sure to read readme.rtf too.  This readme only explains functionality that
is specific to the Linux release of Brogue.

---

Brogue now supports remapped keys.  The remapping engine is quite limited
and is described in bin/keymap.

./brogue is a shell script that will invoke bin/brogue with the appropriate
switches and in the correct working folder.  It therefore serves as an
acceptable target for a desktop shortcut (see make-link-for-desktop.sh for
an easy way to make one.)  It will pass command line arguments along
to bin/brogue.  The following renderer switches are accepted:

-t	force ncurses-based terminal mode
-s	force libtcod mode with an SDL renderer (default)
-gl	force libtcod mode with an OpenGL renderer

The switch that you pass to ./brogue will override the -t it appends in
terminal mode, so ./brogue -gl will start brogue in the traditional libtcod
window.

If you supply the --scores switch, Brogue will dump high scores to the terminal
and exit immediately.

Regrettably, SDL is initialized automatically at present no matter what switch
you supply, unless bin/brogue has been built without libtcod support.


The Makefile accepts these targets:
	make tcod
	make curses
	make both

If you build for curses only, libtcod is not required and SDL will not be linked
or initialized at runtime.  If you build for tcod only, you do not need
ncurses-dev.  If you make either 'tcod' or 'both', the Makefile will
automatically download the 32-bit version of libtcod for you and untar it in
the right place (in src).

To produce a distributable tar file, make tar.  To clean (as you must after
changing headers or before switching targets -- sorry about that), make clean.

make both is the default.
